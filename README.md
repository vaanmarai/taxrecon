## MVP Summary

MVP Summary: AI-Powered Tax Data Reconciler for Australian Accountants
Product Name (Working Title): TaxRecon AI (or similar, something catchy and descriptive)

Target Users: Small to medium-sized accounting firms and independent tax agents in Australia specializing in individual and sole trader tax returns.

Core Problem Solved (The Smallest Value Proposition):
Accountants spend excessive time manually collecting, organizing, and reconciling disparate tax-relevant information (client-provided documents vs. ATO pre-fill data). This leads to inefficiencies, potential errors, missed deductions, and increased audit risk.

Lean Value Proposition:
"Automate the reconciliation of ATO pre-fill data with client-provided financial documents for individual and sole trader tax returns, highlighting all discrepancies and missing information, saving accountants significant time and reducing compliance risk."

Key Features (MVP Scope):

Secure Client Upload Portal:

Functionality: A user-friendly, highly secure online portal for individual and sole trader clients to upload their tax-relevant documents.
Initial Document Types Supported:
ATO myTax pre-fill PDF (client downloads from MyGov and uploads).
PAYG Payment Summaries (digital PDF/image).
Bank Interest Statements (PDF/image).
Dividend/Managed Fund Statements (PDF/image).
Basic sole trader income/expense summaries (e.g., spreadsheet, or a few key receipts).
Security: Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), end-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest, clear privacy policy adhering to Australian regulations.
AI-Powered Data Extraction (OCR & NLP):

Functionality: Utilise advanced OCR and NLP to accurately extract key financial data points from the uploaded PDFs and images.
Extracted Data Examples: Gross income, PAYG withholding, bank interest amounts, dividend income, franking credits, specific sole trader income/expense totals (if structured).
Focus: Initially focus on highly structured documents where extraction accuracy is high.
Automated Reconciliation & Discrepancy Flagging Engine:

Functionality: The core AI engine that compares extracted client data against the data from the ATO pre-fill.
Output: A clear, intuitive report for the accountant, presenting:
Matches: Items where client and ATO data align.
Discrepancies: Items where amounts differ (e.g., client interest $105, ATO pre-fill $100).
ATO Only: Data pre-filled by ATO but not yet reflected in client documents (e.g., a client forgot to upload a payment summary for a short-term job).
Client Only: Data from client documents not present in ATO pre-fill (e.g., deductions not automatically pre-filled).
User Interface (Accountant): A simple dashboard displaying client names and a link to their reconciliation report. The report itself should use visual cues (e.g., colour-coding) for quick identification of discrepancies.
Basic Accountant Review & Action Tracking:

Functionality: Allow the accountant to mark items in the report as "reviewed," "action required," or "resolved."
Note: No direct tax software integration in MVP, focus is on clean data export.
Data Export Functionality:

Functionality: Enable accountants to export the reconciled and structured data (e.g., as a CSV or basic Excel file) for easy import or manual entry into their preferred tax preparation software.
Non-MVP Scope (Future Enhancements):

Direct ATO API integration (requires DSP status â€“ significant effort).
AI-powered deduction maximiser/receipt categorisation (more complex NLP/CV).
Direct API integration with tax preparation software (Xero Tax, MYOB Tax).
Automated client follow-up/communication.
More complex tax calculations (e.g., full CGT, depreciation schedules).
Technical Considerations (Leveraging Your Expertise):

Cloud-Native: Built entirely on a robust cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalability and security.
AI/ML: Utilise off-the-shelf OCR/Document AI APIs (e.g., Google Cloud Vision, AWS Textract) and custom logic/small language models for reconciliation and discrepancy flagging.
Security & Compliance: Top priority from day one. Assume all data is highly sensitive. Plan for potential ATO DSP requirements even if not implemented initially (e.g., audit logging, MFA, data residency, encryption standards).
"Vibe Programming": Focus on rapid prototyping for the client-facing UI to ensure extreme ease of use, reducing friction in data submission.
Monetization Strategy (Lean):

Per-Return/Per-Client Fee: A low, recurring fee (e.g., $X per individual/sole trader client per tax year or per return processed) that aligns directly with the time savings and reduced risk for the accountant.
Initial thought on pricing: Given the value of saving 15-30 minutes of accountant time (which could be $25-$50+ in billable hours), a charge of $5-$15 per processed client file could be compelling.
Success Metrics (MVP):

Accountant Sign-ups/Trial Conversions: How many accountants are willing to try and then pay?
Client Upload Rate: What percentage of an accountant's clients successfully upload their documents?
Time Saved per Return: Collect qualitative and ideally quantitative feedback on time savings.
Accuracy of Reconciliation: Low error rate in flagging discrepancies.
User Feedback: Direct feedback from accountants and their clients on ease of use and value.
